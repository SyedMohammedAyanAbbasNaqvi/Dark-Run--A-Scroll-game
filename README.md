# Dark-Run--A-Scroll-game
Dark Run – A Scroll Game

A Silent Journey Through Fear, Speed, and Shadows.

Dark Run is a fast-paced, side-scrolling survival experience where your scroll wheel is your lifeline. Move through a haunting, ever-shifting forest filled with deadly traps, swooping birds, falling hammers, monster-bushes, giant saws, and silhouettes that warp your vision. Every scroll pushes you forward. Every second counts. Every mistake sends you back into the darkness.

🖤 A Scroll-Controlled Adventure

No buttons.
No complex controls.
Just scroll to run and swipe or press Up to jump.
Simple to learn. Brutal to master.

🌲 A Living, Breathing Dark Forest

The world reacts to you—
Bushes morph into monsters, shadows invert your body, birds dive from above, and giant hammers crash in unpredictable rhythms. The atmosphere is eerie, intense, and beautifully animated.

⚡ Pure Speed. Pure Skill.

The entire game is a race against:

Your reflexes

Hidden traps

Time itself

Your timer starts the moment you scroll. Finish fast enough, and you’ll set a new Best Time.

🔥 Dynamic Dangers

Survive:

Falling hammers swinging at different speeds

Flying birds with erratic flight patterns

Rotating saw blades rising from below

Bushes that randomly turn into monsters

A forest full of hostile silhouettes that distort your vision

Every obstacle is handcrafted and animated to keep you on edge.

🏠 One Goal: Get Home Alive

Your journey ends at the distant house glowing faintly in the dark—
A fragile promise of safety amidst chaos.

Reach it…
and you win.
Fall even once…
and it’s Game Over.

✨ Minimal, Silent, Addictive

No instructions.
No distractions.
Just you, the forest, and the darkness chasing behind you.

Scroll. Survive. Run.
